Plan:

Players stored in Objects (factory!)
Object to control flow of game
gameBoard / displayController -> Module?
fill squares w/ null. If click and !null return
        if (calculateWinner(squares) || squares[i]) {
            return;
        }


Game / Player / Gameboard Objects


Gameboard ->
    Has Square / Render Square?
    an array of 3 buttons per row
    x / o to update the square



Player ->



Game ->
    like everything else



Need to keep track of..
- what button was clicked (add event listener) (G)
    -update DOM w/ X or O (GB)
- who clicked it (G) -> (GB)
- if its valid ( if !null return ) (G)
    - so logic for handling game has to be below this
- if someone won (G)
    - stop play if they win (G)
